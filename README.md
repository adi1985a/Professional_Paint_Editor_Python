*   **Brightness Adjustment**: Modify the overall brightness of the image.
*   **Contrast Adjustment**: Alter the contrast levels in the image.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality
*   **Color Picker**: Select foreground and background colors using a visual color palette or by inputting color codes.
*   **File Operations**:
    *   Create a **New Image** (Ctrl+N).
    *   **Open** existing image files (Ctrl+O) (e.g., PNG, JPG, BMP - supported by Pillow).
    *   **Save** the current image (Ctrl+S) in various formats.
*   **Undo/Redo Support**:
    *   **Undo** previous actions (Ctrl+Z).
    *   **Redo** undone actions (Ctrl+Y).
*   **Canvas Management**: A central drawing area where image editing takes place.
*   **Layers**: (Potential feature, not explicitly listed but common in "professional" editors) Ability to work with multiple image layers.
*   **Zoom & Pan**: (Assumed) Controls to zoom in/out and pan across the image canvas.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

*   **`Ctrl + N`**: Create a New Image
*   **`Ctrl + O`**: Open an Existing Image
*   **`Ctrl + S`**: Save the Current Image
*   **`Ctrl + Z`**: Undo the last action
*   **`Ctrl + Y`**: Redo the last undone action
*   *(Additional shortcuts for tools, e.g., `B` for Brush, `E` for Eraser, would be typical)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements & Dependencies

### Software:
*   **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
*   **Libraries**:
    *   `PyQt5`: For the graphical user interface framework.
    *   `Pillow` (PIL Fork): For image file loading, saving, and manipulation operations.

### Operating System:
*   Any OS that supports Python 3.6+ and PyQt5 (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Ensure Python 3.6+ is Installed**:
    Verify by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal. If not installed, download from [python.org](https.www.python.org/).

2.  **Clone or Download the Repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` if this project is hosted on Git).*

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Required Libraries**:
    Open your terminal or command prompt (with the virtual environment activated if you created one) and run:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5 Pillow
    ```
    *(If a `requirements.txt` file is provided in the future, you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` instead).*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal (the one containing `main.py`).
2.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).
3.  Run the application using Python:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  The PyQt PaintMaster application window should open.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure (Expected)

*   `main.py`: The main Python script that initializes the PyQt5 application, sets up the main window, and integrates all the UI elements, tools, and image processing logic.
*   (Potentially other Python modules/files for):
    *   `canvas.py`: Class for the main drawing canvas widget.
    *   `toolbar.py`: Logic for creating and managing toolbars.
    *   `menubar.py`: Logic for creating and managing the menu bar.
    *   `tools/`: A directory containing separate modules for each drawing tool.
    *   `effects/`: A directory for image effect implementations.
    *   `ui/`: Directory for any `.ui` files if using Qt Designer.
*   `assets/` or `icons/`: (Optional) Directory for any custom icons used in the UI.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

## üìù Technical Notes

*   **GUI Framework**: The application is built using PyQt5, a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt libraries, enabling the creation of rich desktop GUIs.
*   **Image Processing**: Pillow (a fork of the Python Imaging Library - PIL) is used for backend image manipulation tasks such as opening/saving various file formats and applying filters/effects that are not directly handled by Qt's image classes.
*   **Object-Oriented Design**: A professional paint editor would typically employ a strong object-oriented design, with classes for tools, shapes, image layers, effects, and UI components.
*   **Event Handling**: PyQt5's signal and slot mechanism is used for handling user interactions (mouse clicks, key presses, menu selections).
*   **Performance**: For a responsive user experience, especially with large images or complex operations (like blur), efficient algorithms and potentially threading or multiprocessing for certain tasks would be important.

## ü§ù Contributing
